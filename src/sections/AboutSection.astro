                As a web developer, learning something new is my hobby, and I always make myself motivated and productive every day. I enjoy exploring technologies, libraries, tricks, techniques, and best practices to build my projects to run efficiently with beautiful, readable, clean code. I always make myself better than yesterday.

                I'm a bit of a digital product junky. Over the years, I've used hundreds of web and mobile apps in different industries and verticals. Eventually, I decided that it would be a fun challenge to try designing and building my own. I love researching, solving programming problems, and learning technologies and I enjoy coding challenges.

                I like to read, research new technologies, watch movies and TV shows when I'm not writing code. Since I was little, I have been incredibly passionate about all forms of art.
